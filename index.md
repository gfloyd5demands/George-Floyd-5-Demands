## Abolish qualified immunity 

QI is a doctrine created from scratch by judges. It was never enacted into law by a legislature or signed by an executive; judges created it on their own.

And it protects police from being held accountable for their bad judgment.

Qualified immunity means a policeman cannot be sued civilly for violating your rights – killing you, brutalizing you, etc – unless that right was "clearly established" at the time of the violation 

What does "clearly established" mean? Whatever a judge wants.

## Require police to carry malpractice insurance

We require it for doctors, pharmacists, and other professions where you could be killed by incompetence or malice. Police should be no different.

Requiring police to carry insurance serves two goals at the same time: 

(A) it protects taxpayers from having to shell out $$$$$$$$ in settlement money 

and

(B) insurance rates for individual officers will rise based on how bad they are

## Incentivize community policing

Same concept as pay bumps for degrees, but in this case offered to police who actually live in the neighborhoods they patrol.

Police officers are less likely to escalate and kill people when it's their neighbors that they're dealing with.

## Abolish cities' sweetheart deals with police unions

Your head would spin at some of the sh*t police get away with because it's *written into their contracts that they can*

The ability to hop / skip / jump from department to department as officers are fired

Elaborate termination procedures that block their firing in the first place, or enable them to easily get reinstated with back pay

The list goes on


## Make "Brady lists" public record

Every District Attorney's Office in the country knows which cops on which police forces are documented liars who can't be trusted to provide sworn testimony in court

They end up on what are dubbed "Brady lists"

They're not given to defense attorneys, and they're never ever ever ever (ever) given to the public

When California recently enacted new laws to make this info known, police unions went apesh*t and sued to block the laws from taking effect
